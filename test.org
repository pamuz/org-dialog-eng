#+TITLE: org-ai-prompt Test File

* Installation Test

This file helps verify that org-ai-prompt is working correctly.

** Instructions

1. Make sure org-ai-prompt-mode is enabled
   - Look for " AI" in the mode line (bottom of Emacs)
   - If not visible, run: M-x org-ai-prompt-mode

2. Position your cursor anywhere in the PROMPT block below

3. Press C-c C-c

4. Wait a few seconds

5. A RESPONSE block should appear below with Claude's answer

** Test Prompt

#+BEGIN_PROMPT
Say "Hello! org-ai-prompt is working correctly!" if you can read this.
#+END_PROMPT

** What to Expect

After pressing C-c C-c, you should see:
- In the minibuffer: "[org-ai-prompt] Sending prompt to Claude..."
- Then: "[org-ai-prompt] Waiting for Claude's response..."
- Finally: "[org-ai-prompt] Response inserted successfully"
- A new #+BEGIN_RESPONSE block appears above this section

** Troubleshooting

If it doesn't work:

*** Check the mode is enabled
- Look for " AI" in the mode line
- If missing, run: M-x org-ai-prompt-mode

*** Check Claude CLI is installed
Open a terminal and run:
: which claude
: claude -p "test"

Both should work.

*** Check for errors
- Press C-h e (or M-x view-echo-area-messages)
- Look for [org-ai-prompt] error messages
- Common issues:
  - "Failed to start Claude CLI" → Claude not in PATH
  - "PROMPT block is empty" → Make sure there's text in the block

*** Still not working?
Check your configuration in init file:
- (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-dialog-eng")
- (require 'org-ai-prompt)
- (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-ai-prompt-mode)

** Next Steps

Once this works:
1. Try the examples in example.org
2. Create your own .org files with PROMPT blocks
3. Start using Claude from within your notes!
